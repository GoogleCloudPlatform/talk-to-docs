"""
This module contains functionalities to manage and execute language model (LLM) interactions,
document retrieval, response generation, and logging within a conversational AI context. It integrates
several components for handling complex AI tasks, including generating contextual responses,
managing state across conversational turns, and logging interactions for analysis.

The module is structured to process conversations using document retrievers, respond to user queries,
and log conversation states and interactions to BigQuery for further analysis. It uses dependency injection
to manage dependencies and settings, facilitating a flexible and decoupled design.

Functions:
    generate_contexts_from_docs(docs_and_scores, query_state): Generates text contexts from document data.
    get_total_count(question, selected_context, previous_rounds, final_round_statement): Calculates the total 
    token count.
    generate_response_react(conversation): Handles the generation of responses in a reactive conversation cycle.
    respond(conversation, member_info): Processes a full conversational round, updating the conversation state.
    respond_api(question, member_context_full): Provides an API-like interface to handle incoming queries and 
    generate responses.

Classes:
    None

Dependencies:
    - gen_ai.common: Provides common utilities and configurations.
    - langchain: Used for language model operations.
    - json5: Used for JSON parsing.

def get_total_count(question: str, selected_context: str, previous_rounds: str, final_round_statement: str) -> str:
    """
    Calculates the total token count for a given context setup in a conversational AI environment.

    This function constructs a full prompt from various components of a conversation including the main question,
    selected context from documents, any preceding rounds of conversation, and a final statement if it is the last
    round. It then calculates the total number of tokens this combined prompt would take up when processed by a
    language model, assisting in managing and optimizing language model input size constraints.

    Args:
        question (str): The primary question being addressed in the conversation.
        selected_context (str): The context selected from documents relevant to the question.
        previous_rounds (str): Accumulated context from previous rounds of the conversation, maintaining the
                               continuity necessary for the language model.
        final_round_statement (str): A concluding statement used in the final round of the conversation, often
                                     summarizing or closing the discussion.

    Returns:
        str: The total token count as a string, representing the sum of tokens from all parts of the constructed prompt.

    Example:
        >>> question = "What are the benefits of renewable energy?"
        >>> selected_context = "Renewable energy, often referred to as clean energy, comes from natural sources..."
        >>> previous_rounds = "Previous discussions included solar and wind energy."
        >>> final_round_statement = "This concludes our discussion on renewable energy."
        >>> token_count = get_total_count(question, selected_context, previous_rounds, final_round_statement)
        >>> print(token_count)
        '120'  # Example output, the actual number depends on the tokenization process.

    Note:
        The token count helps in managing inputs to language models, especially when dealing with models that have
        a maximum token input limit. Ensuring that the prompt does not exceed this limit is crucial for
        effective processing.
