{"What should be done if the pharmacy submits a claim with clarification code and the claim still rejects?": "If the pharmacy submits a claim with a clarification code and the claim still rejects, the pharmacy should check the Submitted Drug Utilization Review again. There may be more than one issue with the claim. For example, the member could have an Ingredient Duplication and a High Dose Alert on the same claim. The pharmacy should not create an override for the pharmacy."}
